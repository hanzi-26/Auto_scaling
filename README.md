# Multi-access Edge Computing

## Intro
Reduce data transmission distance and network latency
Alleviates the network congestion problem
Save network bandwidth resources
Providing high quality of service to the devices

## Evironment based on python
The environment contains six situations:

1. server to server
2. server to cloud
3. cloud to server
4. assigned to cloud
5. no migration

## Cost function
Considered of *transmission delay, backehaul delay, computation delay, download delay, scaling delay, migration delay, migration delay*.
